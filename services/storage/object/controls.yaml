    title: Prevent Requests to Buckets or Objects with Untrusted KMS Keys
    objective: |
      Prevent any requests to object storage buckets or objects using untrusted
      KMS keys to protect against unauthorized data encryption that can impact
      data availability and integrity.

    test_requirements:
      01: |
        Verify that access policies for cloud storage buckets and objects
        prevent requests with untrusted KMS keys. In this case, an untrusted
        KMS key is one that is not specified as trusted by the cloud storage
        bucket owner.
