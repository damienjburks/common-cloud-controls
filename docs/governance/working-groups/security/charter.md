# Security Working Group

This [WG] defines and maintains the delivery process for the Common Cloud Controls project deliverables.

## Mission

The mission of the Security [WG] is to develop, maintain, and enhance a comprehensive threat-informed security controls catalog specifically tailored to the CCC cloud services taxonomy. Additionally, the working group will explore how existing security controls catalogs can be leveraged to assess the security posture of cloud services, define methodologies for conducting such assessments, and ensure alignment with industry standards and best practices.

## Approach

- Maintain open and transparent communication channels for all WG activities and decisions in regard to outputs/deliverables
- Maintain a list of all community outputs that need to be released
- Determine best process for versioning/releasing the output owners content

## Responsibilities

- Create and maintain a detailed security controls catalog outlining effective measures to mitigate identified threats.
- Define methodologies and criteria for assessing the effectiveness of security controls, including leveraging existing security controls catalogs, risk-based assessments, compliance frameworks, and testing procedures.
- Explore how existing security controls catalogs, such as CIS benchmarks, NIST SP 800-53, and ISO/IEC 27001, can be utilized to assess the security posture of cloud services.
- Develop guidelines and frameworks for conducting assessments of cloud services' security posture using existing security controls catalogs, ensuring thorough coverage of relevant security domains and alignment with industry standards.
- Collaborate with industry experts, security researchers, and cloud service providers to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the catalogs, assessment methodologies, and exploration of existing controls catalogs.
- Regularly update and expand the catalogs, assessment methodologies, and exploration of existing controls catalogs to reflect evolving threats, emerging technologies, and best practices in cloud security.
- Provide guidance and support to users, developers, and organizations in implementing recommended security controls within their cloud environments, conducting assessments using existing controls catalogs, and aligning with industry standards and best practices.

### Output / Deliverables

This group should, at minimum, create and maintain the following items in the project GitHub repository.

- Security controls catalog [WG]
