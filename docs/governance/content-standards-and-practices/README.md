## Purpose

This directory will contain the content standards and practices, where you can find all the necessary guidelines and standards for formatting, linting, and releasing content within our projects. The purpose of this folder is to provide clear, accessible guidelines that enhance our workflows and maintain high standards of quality. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of our products.

All [WG] charters should contain a reference to these standards and practices, with a commitment to adhere to any standards and practices that apply to that group's circumstance. This contrasts with [community-guidelines], which are recommendations that the community is strongly advised to consider.

## How to Use These Guidelines

1. **Review Guidelines Before Starting Your Project:** Familiarize yourself with the formatting and linting standards to ensure your work aligns from the outset.
2. **Apply the Standards Consistently:** Use the tools and configurations recommended in these guidelines to maintain consistency across all files.
3. **Check Compliance Regularly:** Regularly review your work against these standards to ensure ongoing compliance, especially before merges and releases.
